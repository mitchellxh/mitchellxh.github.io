In addition to this, I serve as the research computing liaison for the Rajen Kilachand Center for Integrated Life Sciences & Engineering at Boston University where I'm dedicated to developing exploratory, centralized, and optimized computational workflows in neuroscience. I earned my BEng in Biomedical Engineering and am enrolled in the MS in Data Analytics program at Boston University. I previously held neuroimaging research positions at Harvard Medical School, Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, and Boston University School of Medicine. Currently, I hold the position of Research Computing Data and Applications Specialist at Boston University. More about our group and what we do can be explored at rcs.bu.edu."
